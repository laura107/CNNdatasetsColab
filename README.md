In the handwriting file I used the MNIST dataset, well-known in machine learning, to develop a model capable of recognizing handwritten digits. 70,000 grayscale images of digits 0-9, each sized 28x28 pixels. I
preprocessed the data by numbering pixel values and implemented a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras. The model was trained on 60,000 images and evaluated on 10,000 test images, achieving high accuracy in
recognizing handwritten digits.

The face detection file uses an OpenCV face detection dataset with the headless package to build a face detection system. Suitable for server environments without graphical interfaces. The system processes images to
identify and highlight faces, demonstrating robust performance in accurately detecting facial features across different lighting conditions and orientations

Blurry image detection was solved via the development of a convolutional neural network model for recognising objects in blurry images. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model was trained on a dataset of 
blurry images containing various objects and their corresponding labels. By using convolutional layers to extract meaningful features and incorporating techniques such as data augmentation to enhance model 
generalisation, the CNN achieved robust performance in accurately identifying objects within blurry images. The project showcases the effectiveness of CNNs in handling challenging visual tasks, demonstrating their 
potential applications in real-world scenarios where image quality may be compromised.
